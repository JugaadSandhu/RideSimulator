# RideSimulator - Driver Request Simulation and Management

RideSimulator is a Python application designed to simulate and manage driver requests based on user-defined events and driver availability. This tool is useful for testing and evaluating ride-sharing or taxi service algorithms and systems.

## Features

- **Driver Simulation**: Simulates driver availability and movement based on user-defined events.
- **Event Customization**: Allows users to customize events by editing the `events.txt` file.
- **Request Management**: Manages driver requests, matches drivers with riders, and simulates rides.
- **Data Logging**: Logs simulation data for analysis and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the RideSimulator application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the RideSimulator repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the RideSimulator directory.

3. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the main simulation script by running `simulation.py`:

   ```shell
   python simulation.py

**Customize Events (Optional)**

Edit the events.txt file to define custom events for your simulation. Each line represents an event with a timestamp, event type, and event-specific details.

**Analyze Results:**
After the simulation is complete, review the logs and results to evaluate the effectiveness of your driver request management system.

Thank you for using the RideSimulator application!
